# My personal page/portfolio

Hey, I'm Marcin Otto and welcome to my portfolio! Explore it to get to know me or dive into the code to learn about my coding skills. Hope you enjoy it!

## Techs

Project powered by **React**, using **react-three-fiber** to create all the fancy 3D effect, **glsl** to make custom shaders, **styled-components** to get rid of a lot of styling sheets and **wouter** for the routing.

## Special thanks

- to **Bruno Simon** for creating the best Three.js course - [Three.js Journey](https://threejs-journey.com/)
