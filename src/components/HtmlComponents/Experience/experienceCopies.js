    description: `I was honored by my thesis supervisor by inviting me to the team building 3D facial scanning system. Main part of my contribution was developing an application for viewing resulting point cloud. This assignment made me learn react, which powers the core of the app, and three.js to build 3D features. Other technologies I used were potree - point cloud renderer and GSAP to make eye pleasing animations of the scene. Beside the view on point cloud, the app also contains menu and sphere of photos - small window with 3D model of head angularly aligned with point cloud. The name stands for tiles of photos depicting scanned person which are surrounding the model. My second role in the project involved researching ability to enhance results of the scanner by face morphing technique. This task was also a subject of my masterâ€™s thesis, which is described in details in the education page. `,
